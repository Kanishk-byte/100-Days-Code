# 100 Days of Code

Welcome to my "100 Days of Code" repository! This project documents my journey of coding every day for 100 consecutive days. During this period, I focused on improving my C++ programming skills and deepening my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## Introduction

The "100 Days of Code" challenge is a self-improvement project where participants commit to coding for at least an hour every day for 100 days. My focus was on enhancing my skills in C++ and exploring various data structures and algorithms. This repository contains all the code and notes from my journey.

## Goals

- Improve proficiency in C++.
- Master fundamental data structures and algorithms.
- Build a habit of coding daily.
- Document the learning process for future reference and for others to benefit from.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Tools and IDEs:** Visual Studio Code, GCC, GDB
- **Version Control:** Git

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each day, with each folder containing the code and notes for that day.
